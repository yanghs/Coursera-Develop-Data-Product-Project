# Coursera-Develop-Data-Product-Project
This is a project to use shiny and slidify for presentation.

This application has been created as a course project for the Developing Data Products course on Coursera.

The original version is available for reference on http://yanghs.shinyapps.io/my_app, and the supporting documents for the presentation can be viewed on GitHub.

## Purpose of the shiny app
The shiny app is used to visualize the effect on fuel efficiency in terms of the histogram of miles/gallon by different factors, such as type of transmissions, Number of cylinders, and Number of forward gears.

## Data 
The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973-74 models). The data can be accessed by loading mtcars dataset in R.  The variable description is as follows.

The data set "mtcars" in R include 32 observations on 11 variables.

[, 1]	 mpg	 Miles/(US) gallon
[, 2]	 cyl	 Number of cylinders
[, 3]	 disp	 Displacement (cu.in.)
[, 4]	 hp	 Gross horsepower
[, 5]	 drat	 Rear axle ratio
[, 6]	 wt	 Weight (lb/1000)
[, 7]	 qsec	 1/4 mile time
[, 8]	 vs	 V/S
[, 9]	 am	 Transmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual)
[,10]	 gear	 Number of forward gears
[,11]	 carb	 Number of carburetors
